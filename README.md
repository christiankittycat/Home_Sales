# Home Sales Project

This project analyzes home sales data to gain insights into the real estate market. It is based on two notebooks available in the workspace: `notebook1.ipynb` and `notebook2.ipynb`.

## Notebook 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

In `notebook1.ipynb`, the focus is on cleaning and preprocessing the raw home sales data. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Handling missing values
3. Removing duplicates
4. Feature engineering
5. Data normalization

## Notebook 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

`notebook2.ipynb` dives into exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the home sales data. The notebook includes the following analyses:

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Data visualization using charts and graphs
3. Correlation analysis
4. Hypothesis testing

## Conclusion

By combining the data cleaning and preprocessing techniques from `notebook1.ipynb` with the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis in `notebook2.ipynb`, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the home sales market.
